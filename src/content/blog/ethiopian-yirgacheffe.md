Our Ethiopian Yirgacheffe is one of our most beloved single-origin coffees—and for good reason. Grown in the highlands of southern Ethiopia, this 12 oz whole bean offering delivers a cup that's bright, floral, and distinctly citrusy. Here's everything you need to know about it.

## The Origin

Yirgacheffe is a *woreda* (district) in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia's Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. The area sits at elevations between 1,700 and 2,200 meters, where cool nights, ample rainfall, and rich, volcanic soil create ideal conditions for coffee cultivation. Many farmers here still grow heirloom varieties—landrace cultivars that have evolved in Ethiopia over centuries—which contribute to the coffee's unique, complex character.

## Flavor Profile

When you open a bag of our Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, you'll notice a fragrant, tea-like aroma. In the cup, expect:

- **Bright acidity** — Clean, wine-like, with a crisp finish
- **Floral notes** — Jasmine and bergamot, especially when brewed as pour-over
- **Citrus** — Lemon, orange zest, and sometimes grapefruit
- **Light body** — Silky and delicate, not heavy or syrupy

This is a coffee that rewards attention. It's perfect for slow mornings, weekend listening sessions, or any moment when you want to actually taste what's in your mug.

## Brewing Recommendations

We designed this coffee with **pour-over** in mind. A V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave will highlight its clarity and brightness. Use a medium-fine grind, water just off the boil (around 200°F), and a ratio of about 1:16 (coffee to water). AeroPress works beautifully too—slightly coarser grind, shorter steep—and brings out more body if you prefer something a bit rounder.

Avoid dark roasts and heavy cream if you want to experience the full spectrum of flavors. A splash of milk is fine, but this one shines best black.

## Why It Pairs With Vinyl

At Brew & Groove, we believe coffee and music belong together. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe's bright, nuanced character mirrors the kind of listening that rewards patience—jazz, ambient, acoustic, anything that unfolds over time. Put on *Kind of Blue*, pour a cup, and let both do their thing. You won't regret it.
