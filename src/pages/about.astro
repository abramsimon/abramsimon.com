			Brew & Groove started as a simple idea: a place where the crackle of vinyl and the hiss of a
			steam wand could live in perfect harmony. By day, we pull espresso shots and pour-over
			brews for neighbors on their way to work. By night, we dim the lights, turn up the turntables,
			and let the records spin.
		</p>

		<p>
			Every corner of the shop is designed to feel like your favorite retro living room—warm wood
			tones, worn-in leather, and flickers of neon green that echo the glow of vintage hi-fi gear.
			Whether you're digging through crates for a rare pressing or journaling over a cappuccino,
			there's always a cozy spot waiting for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			We keep a rotating selection of coffees from small roasters and a curated wall of albums
			spanning soul, jazz, funk, and lo-fi beats. Some nights we host listening parties, where an
			entire record plays front to back—no skips, no algorithms, just shared focus on the music.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you love slow rituals, analog sound, and the feeling of time stretching out over a great cup
			of coffee, you’ll fit right in at Brew & Groove.
